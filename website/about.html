    <h2>üåç Mission</h2>
    <p>
      MolecularMap is mapping every molecule and its connections into a unified, AI-ready dataset.
      Unlike traditional molecular knowledge graphs that serve as reference databases,
      MolecularMap is designed for machine learning ‚Äî curated, multimodal, and built to
      power the next generation of discovery in health, drug development, and synthetic biology.
    </p>

    <h2>üìú Patents & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Our core technologies are protected by awarded U.S. patents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>US9,018,506 (2015)</strong> ‚Äî <em>System and method for creating audible sound representations of atoms and molecules</em></li>
      <li><strong>US10,381,108 (2019)</strong> ‚Äî <em>Web search and information aggregation by way of molecular network</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, we have multiple pending applications covering AI-based molecular analysis,
      multimodal foundation models, and clinical/diagnostic applications ‚Äî
      with further filings anticipated as our platform expands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This IP portfolio establishes a unique and defensible data moat,
      ensuring MolecularMap remains the first and only AI-ready atlas of molecules at global scale.
    </p>

    <h2>Vision for AI & Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Just as <strong>ImageNet</strong> enabled breakthroughs in computer vision,
      MolecularMap provides the large-scale, curated dataset required to train
      molecular machine learning models. Each node in the graph represents a molecule,
      enriched with chemical, biological, and clinical data, as well as
      multimodal fingerprints including <strong>audio sonification</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to unlock new AI-driven insights into disease mechanisms, drug discovery,
      and material design ‚Äî making MolecularMap a foundational dataset for
      the future of molecular intelligence.
