# 🌌 MolecularMap

**MolecularMap** is the **Universal Molecular Knowledge Graph** — an AI-first initiative to map every molecule and its relationships, powering the next generation of molecular AI, drug discovery, and biology.

## 🔬 Mission

Billions of molecules form the foundation of life, health, and technology. Yet they remain fragmented across siloed databases.  
MolecularMap unifies molecules, properties, pathways, and multimodal fingerprints into one **curated, AI-ready knowledge graph**.

We are building the **ImageNet for molecules** — a dataset and platform that enables foundation models for chemistry, biology, and medicine.

## 📂 Project Structure

- 🌐 **Website**: public landing page, dataset access, contribution forms  
- 📦 **Datasets**: curated exports in JSON, CSV, RDF, Neo4j graph dumps  
- 🔗 **API (coming soon)**: programmatic access to molecules, properties, and pathways  
- 🎶 **MolAudioNet Integration**: each molecule can be represented in sound (patent-pending)  

---

## 📊 Dataset Licensing

- **Academic & Non-Profit**: free access, with citation required  
- **Commercial & Industry**: license required, includes large curated datasets + support  

See [License Terms](https://molecularmap.com/license.html) for details.
